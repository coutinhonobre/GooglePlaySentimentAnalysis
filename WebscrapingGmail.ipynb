      "  Review: Before the lite version launched, i was using the normal version, but it was really laggy and heavy for my phone, so I changed to Gmail. Now 1 week before i was scrolling on play store and came up to this masterpiece! It's so lite, not baggy at all, the only problem is that it runs on internet so you can't check your drafts when you are offline for example.\n",

      "  Review: After installing and adding 1 Hotmail then I select to add another Hotmail and it says I can't add another Hotmail. at least 2 would be better than 1. The regular outlook would not let me sign in so I had to use this. I did not want to use other apps that says 8 can use Hotmail but they all have to many adds but now I can only check on 1 email only when I'm away from home. ADDED NOTE: OK U SAY your working to add at least 1 more email but when is that going to happen 1 year or more!!\n",
